# Chambers
This plugin is a replica of FrozenOrb's popular gamemode called Bunkers. I will only work on it when I have time to work on it, so please do not contact me to update it for a certain reason. It will be free and open-source, and because of that, it will all be hard-coded. If you wish to edit the messages, than clone the repository and then edit the messages yourself.
